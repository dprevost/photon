Version 0.1

    *   Data components:
          o Folders (to hold the other data components)
          o Hash Maps
          o Queues (FIFO only)
    * Transactions
    * C API
    * Man pages for the C API
    * i18n (internationalization)

Version 0.2

    * C++ API
    * Some crash-recovery features at startup
    * Better isolation policy at startup
    * A pseudo-shell utility (vdssh)

Version 0.3

    * The project was renamed to photon
    * LIFO queues
    * XML to describe content of data components
    * Fast Maps (a read-only version of the hash maps)
    
Version 0.4

    * Transactions are now fully atomic.
    * Ticket 13 is resolved (severe issue with locking).
    * The API can be used standalone (without quasar running), as long
      as there is an existing shared-memory backstore file.
    * Quasar can be used to create/verify a backstore file and then exit
      (with the new -e, --exit option). This can be use to prepare the
      software to be used standalone.
