<!-- Directory for the shared-memory file and support 
     files. The files will be created if needed.
     Note: this example use /tmp but this might not be a good idea 
     if /tmp is clean on reboot. -->

<!-- MemorySize is in kbytes ("kb"), megabytes ("mb") or gigabytes ("gb"). 
     For example a shared memory of 10 Megabytes can either be written as
       <mem_size size="10240" units="kb" />
     or
       <mem_size size="10" units="mb" />.

     On many modern systems, only the actual pages in use will
     be loaded - therefore this parameter can be quite large 
     (you'll need the space on disk however - in fact twice as
     large to accomodate a backup of the memory file). -->
<mem_size size="10240" units="kb" />

<!-- The tcp/ip port used by the API clients and the server to
     communicate. The port is bind to a local address (127.0.0.1)
     and cannot be accessed from a different computer for obvious
     security reasons. The port must be between 1025 and 65535. -->

     Which "class" of users should have full access to the shared-memory
     backstore and all other related files?
     
     In other words, which class of users can access/use Photon?
     
     Three possible answers:
       "user" - only the user that launched/will launch the server (and 
                created/will create the files).
       "group" - only users that belong to the same group of the user that 
                 launched/will launched the server...
       "world" - no restriction - all users are allowed. Not recommended in
                 most cases.

     If the user launching the server belongs to more than one group,
     you can specify which group should be used by using something like this:

       <file_access access="group" group="photon"/>

     Note: this is mainly for future development, for example if you
     want the web server (or a database or...) to access shared memory,
     you can create a group, photon, and add the user apache (or
     equivalent) to this group. -->
<file_access access="group" />
