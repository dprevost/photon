.SH DESCRIPTION
quasar is the shared-memory creator and keeper and the crash-recovery server
of the Photon Framework. Currently, crash recovery is only done when this program is 
started.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-c\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-config\fR\*(T> \fIconfig_filename\fR
The name of the configuration file (see 
CONFIGURATION [\fBquasar\fR(1)]
below).
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-d\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-daemon\fR\*(T>
Become a Unix daemon. Error reporting is done using the system logger (syslog).
This option is not available on Windows.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-h\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-help\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-?\fR\*(T>
Display minimal usage information.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-t\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-test\fR\*(T>
Test the configuration file and exit.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-v\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-verify\fR\*(T>
Verify the content of the shared-memory file without modifying it 
and exit.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file is a simple XML file with tags, values and 
attributes as explained below.
.TP 
\fImem_location\fR
The path of the directory where the server will find the shared-memory file
and auxiliary files (these files will be created if they do not exist).

Example: <mem_location>/tmp/photon</mem_location>
.TP 
\fImem_size\fR
The total size of the shared memory. This size canbe expressed in multiple
units, kbytes ("kb"), megabytes ("mb") or gigabytes ("gb"). 
For example a shared memory of 10 Megabytes can either be written as 

<mem_size size="10240" units="kb" />

or 

<mem_size size="10" units="mb" />.

On many modern systems, only the actual pages in use will
be loaded - therefore this parameter can be quite large 
(you'll need the space on disk however - in fact twice as
large to accomodate a backup of the memory file). 
.TP 
\fIWatchdogAddress\fR
The local TCP/IP port the watchdog will use to listen for new connection 
requests.
.TP 
\fIFilePermissions\fR
The file permissions used for the shared-memory file.
.TP 
\fIDirectoryPermissions\fR
The file permissions used for the directory holding the shared-memory file.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
