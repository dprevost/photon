Name

quasar -- starts the Photon server



Synopsis
********



Testing the configuration file (and exit):
==========================================

`quasar -c|--config' _config_filename _`-t|--test'



Verifying the shared memory (and exit):
=======================================

`quasar -c|--config' _config_filename _`-v|--verify'



Getting (minimal) help:
=======================

`quasar -h|--help|-?'



Running normally:
=================

`quasar -c|--config' _config_filename _[`-d|--daemon']



DESCRIPTION
***********

quasar is the shared-memory creator and keeper and the crash-recovery
server of the Photon Framework. Currently, crash recovery is only done
when this program is started.



OPTIONS
*******

`-c', `--config' CONFIG_FILENAME
     The name of the configuration file (see CONFIGURATION (*note
     CONFIGURATION::) below).

`-d', `--daemon'
     Become a Unix daemon. Error reporting is done using the system
     logger (syslog).  This option is not available on Windows.

`-h', `--help', `-?'
     Display minimal usage information.

`-t', `--test'
     Test the configuration file and exit.

`-v', `--verify'
     Verify the content of the shared-memory file without modifying it
     and exit.


CONFIGURATION
*************

The configuration file is a simple XML file with tags, values and
attributes as explained below.

_mem_location_
     The path of the directory where the server will find the
     shared-memory file and auxiliary files (these files will be
     created if they do not exist).

     Example: <mem_location>/tmp/photon</mem_location>

_mem_size_
     The total size of the shared memory. This size canbe expressed in
     multiple units, kbytes ("kb"), megabytes ("mb") or gigabytes
     ("gb").  For example a shared memory of 10 Megabytes can either be
     written as

     <mem_size size="10240" units="kb" />

     or

     <mem_size size="10" units="mb" />.

     On many modern systems, only the actual pages in use will be
     loaded - therefore this parameter can be quite large (you'll need
     the space on disk however - in fact twice as large to accomodate a
     backup of the memory file).

_WatchdogAddress_
     The local TCP/IP port the watchdog will use to listen for new
     connection requests.

_FilePermissions_
     The file permissions used for the shared-memory file.

_DirectoryPermissions_
     The file permissions used for the directory holding the
     shared-memory file.
