Synopsis
********



Testing the configuration file (and exit):
==========================================

`quasar -c|--config' _config_filename _`-t|--test'



Verifying the shared memory (and exit):
=======================================

`quasar -c|--config' _config_filename _`-v|--verify'



Getting (minimal) help:
=======================

`quasar -h|--help|-?'



Running normally:
=================

`quasar -c|--config' _config_filename _[`-d|--daemon']



DESCRIPTION
***********

quasar is the shared-memory creator and keeper and the crash-recovery
server of the Photon Framework. Currently, crash recovery is only done
when this program is started.



OPTIONS
*******

`-c', `--config' CONFIG_FILENAME
     The name of the configuration file (see CONFIGURATION (*note
     CONFIGURATION::) below).

`-d', `--daemon'
     Become a Unix daemon. Error reporting is done using the system
     logger (syslog).  This option is not available on Windows.

`-h', `--help', `-?'
     Display minimal usage information.

`-t', `--test'
     Test the configuration file and exit.

`-v', `--verify'
     Verify the content of the shared-memory file without modifying it
     and exit.


CONFIGURATION
*************

The configuration file is a simple XML file with tags, values and
attributes as explained below.

_mem_location_
     The path of the directory where the server will find the
     shared-memory file and auxiliary files (these files will be
     created if they do not exist).

     Example: <mem_location>/tmp/photon</mem_location>

_mem_size_
     The total size of the shared memory. This size can be expressed in
     multiple units, kbytes ("kb"), megabytes ("mb") or gigabytes
     ("gb").  For example a shared memory of 10 Megabytes can either be
     written as

     <mem_size size="10240" units="kb" />

     or

     <mem_size size="10" units="mb" />.

     On many modern systems, only the actual pages in use will be
     loaded - therefore this parameter can be quite large (you'll need
     the space on disk however - in fact twice as large to accomodate a
     backup of the memory file).

_quasar_address_
     The local TCP/IP port the server will use to listen for new
     connection requests.

     Example: <quasar_address>10701</quasar_address>

_file_access access_
     This parameter defines which "class" of users should have full
     access to the shared-memory backstore and all other related files.
     In other words, the class of users that can access and use Photon
     (Unix only).

     Three possible answers:

     "user" - only the user that launched/will launch the server (and
     created/will create the files).

     "group" - only users that belong to the same group of the user that
     launched/will launched the server...

     "world" - no restriction - all users are allowed. Not recommended
     in most cases.

     If the user launching the server belongs to more than one group,
     you can specify which group should be used by using something like
     this:

     <file_access access="group" group="photon"/>

     Note: this is mainly for future development, for example if you
     want the web server (or a database or...) to access shared memory,
     you can create a group, photon, and add the user apache (or
     equivalent) to this group.
