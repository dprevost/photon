DESCRIPTION
***********

quasar is the crash-recovery daemon (the watchdog) of the Photon
Framework. Currently, crash recovery is only done when this program is
started.



OPTIONS
*******

`-c', `--config' CONFIG_FILENAME
     The name of the configuration file (see CONFIGURATION (*note
     CONFIGURATION::) below).

`-d', `--daemon'
     Become a Unix daemon. Error reporting is done using the system
     logger (syslog).  This option is not available on Windows.

`-h', `--help', `-?'
     Display minimal usage information.

`-t', `--test'
     Test the configuration file and exit.

`-v', `--verify'
     Verify the content of the shared-memory file (VDS) without
     modifying it and exit.


CONFIGURATION
*************

The syntax of the configuration file is very simple, pairs of keys and
values.  Lines starting with # are comments.

_VDSLocation_
     The path of the directory where the watchdog will find the
     shared-memory file and auxiliary files (these files will be
     created if they do not exist).

_MemorySize_
     The total size of the shared memory in units of kiloBytes.

_WatchdogAddress_
     The local TCP/IP port the watchdog will use to listen for new
     connection requests.

_FilePermissions_
     The file permissions used for the shared-memory file.

_DirectoryPermissions_
     The file permissions used for the directory holding the
     shared-memory file.

**************
