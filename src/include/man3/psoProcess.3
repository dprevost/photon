.PP
The destructor terminates all access to shared memory. 
.PP
This function will also close all sessions and terminate all accesses to the different objects.

.SS "void pso::Process::Init (std::string & address, std::string & processName)"
.PP
This function initializes access to the shared-memory of Photon. 
.PP
The process name is optional. If not used (an empty string), the process id will be used to generate a name automatically.
.PP
\fBProcess\fP names are unique - if a process with the same name already exist, a number will be appended to the name.
.PP
This feature creates a system folder under the '\\proc' folder of Photon that will be used in future releases to put process and session specific information, for examples statistics for the current process.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIaddress\fP The address of Quasar, currently a string with the port number and the prefix 'port:' - 'port:12345'. It can also be the name of the shared-memory file - in this case add the prefix 'file:' to the file name. 
.br
\fIprocessName\fP An optional name to identify the process. This name can be empty (the string '') - the process id of the process will be used to generate the name.
.RE
.PP
\fBExceptions:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpso::Exception\fP An abnormal error occured.
