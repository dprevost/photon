\fBEnumerator: \fP
.in +1c
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OK \fP\fP
No error. 
.PP
.. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_INTERNAL_ERROR \fP\fP
Abnormal internal error - it should not happen! 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_ENGINE_BUSY \fP\fP
Cannot get a lock on a system object, the engine is 'busy'. 
.PP
This might be the result of either a very busy system where unused cpu cycles are rare or a lock might be held by a crashed process (however the watchdog should catch this one). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NOT_ENOUGH_VDS_MEMORY \fP\fP
Not enough memory in the VDS. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NOT_ENOUGH_HEAP_MEMORY \fP\fP
Not enough heap memory (non-VDS memory). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_INVALID_OBJECT_NAME \fP\fP
Permitted characters for names are alphanumerics [a-z,0-9], spaces (' '), dashes ('-') and underlines ('_'). 
.PP
The first character must be alphanumeric. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NO_SUCH_OBJECT \fP\fP
The object was not found (but its folder does exist). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NO_SUCH_FOLDER \fP\fP
Invalid folder name. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_ALREADY_PRESENT \fP\fP
Attempt to create an object which already exists. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_IN_USE \fP\fP
Attempt to delete an object which is currently in use. 
.PP
The object might be used either by the current session or by another session. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_INVALID_LENGTH_FIELD \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_IS_EMPTY \fP\fP
The object (data container) is empty. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_NOT_INITIALIZED \fP\fP
Object must be open first before you can access them. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_CONFIG_ERROR \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_INVALID_WATCHDOG_ADDRESS \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_WRONG_OBJECT_TYPE \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_PROCESS_NOT_INITIALIZED \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_CANNOT_GET_LOCK \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_ALREADY_OPEN \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_PROCESS_ALREADY_INITIALIZED \fP\fP
You must call vdsProcess::Terminate() before calling vdsProcess::Initialize() a second time. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSIONS \fP\fP
API - memory-file version mismatch. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NO_ROLLBACK \fP\fP
Rollback operations are not permitted for implicit transactions. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_LOGFILE_ERROR \fP\fP
Error opening the log file (used for transactions). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_REACHED_THE_END \fP\fP
The search reached the end without finding a new item/record. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_INVALID_ITERATOR \fP\fP
An invalid value was used for a vdsIteratorType parameter. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES \fP\fP
There are not enough resources to correctly process the call. 
.PP
This might be due to a lack of POSIX semaphores on systems where locks are implemented that way or a failure in initializing a pthread_mutex (or on Windows, a critical section). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NO_CONFIG_FILE \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_SOCKET_ERROR \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_CONNECT_ERROR \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_SEND_ERROR \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_RECEIVE_ERROR \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_BACKSTORE_FILE_MISSING \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_ERROR_OPENING_VDS \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_FOLDER_IS_NOT_EMPTY \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_WRONG_TYPE_HANDLE \fP\fP
The provided handle is of the wrong type. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NULL_HANDLE \fP\fP
The provided handle is NULL (zero). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_NAME_TOO_LONG \fP\fP
The name of the object is too long. 
.PP
The maximum length of a name cannot be more than VDS_MAX_NAME_LENGTH (or VDS_MAX_FULL_NAME_LENGTH for the fully qualified name). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_SESSION_CANNOT_GET_LOCK \fP\fP
Cannot get a lock on the session (a pthread_mutex or a critical section on Windows). 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_SESSION_IS_TERMINATED \fP\fP
An attempt was made to use a session object (a session handle) after this session was terminated. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_ITEM_ALREADY_PRESENT \fP\fP
An item with the same key was found. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_NO_SUCH_ITEM \fP\fP
The item was not found in the hash map. 
.TP
\fB\fIVDS_OBJECT_IS_DELETED \fP\fP
The object is scheduled to be deleted soon.
