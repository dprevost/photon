.SS "void vdsFolder::CreateObject (const char * objectName, size_t nameLengthInBytes, vdsObjectDefinition * pDefinition)"
.PP
Create a new object in shared memory as a child of the current folder. 
.PP
The creation of the object only becomes permanent after a call to vdsSession::vdsCommit.
.PP
This function does not provide a handle or an object to the newly created shared-memory object. Use vdsQueue::Open and similar functions to access them.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIobjectName\fP The name of the object. 
.br
\fInameLengthInBytes\fP The length of \fIobjectName\fP (in bytes) not counting the null terminator.

.SS "int vdsFolder::GetFirst (vdsFolderEntry * pEntry)"
.PP
Iterate through the folder - no data items are removed from the folder by this function. 
.PP
Data items which were added by another session and are not yet committed will not be seen by the iterator. Likewise, destroyed data items (even if not yet committed) are invisible.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpEntry\fP The data structure provided by the user to hold the content of each item in the folder. Memory allocation for this buffer is the responsability of the caller.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success or VDS_IS_EMPTY if the folder is empty.

.SS "int vdsFolder::GetNext (vdsFolderEntry * pEntry)"
.PP
Iterate through the folder. 
.PP
Data items which were added by another session and are not yet committed will not be seen by the iterator. Likewise, destroyed data items (even if not yet committed) are invisible.
.PP
Evidently, you must call \fBvdsFolder::GetFirst\fP to initialize the iterator.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpEntry\fP The data structure provided by the user to hold the content of each item in the folder. Memory allocation for this buffer is the responsability of the caller.
