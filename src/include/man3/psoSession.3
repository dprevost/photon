.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "psoSession::psoSession ()"
.PP
.SS "virtual psoSession::~psoSession ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
.PP
Terminate the current session and destroy this object. 
.PP
An implicit call to Rollback is executed by this destructor. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void psoSession::Commit ()"
.PP
Commit all insertions and deletions (of the current session) executed since the previous call to Commit or Rollback. 
.PP
Insertions and deletions subjected to this call include both data items inserted and deleted from data containers (maps, etc.) and objects themselves created with CreateObject and/or destroyed with DestroyObject.
.PP
Note: the internal calls executed by the engine to satisfy this request cannot fail. As such, you cannot find yourself with an ugly situation where some operations were committed and others not. If this function thows an exception, nothing was committed.

.SS "void psoSession::CreateObject (const std::string & objectName, psoObjectDefinition * pDefinition)"
.PP
Create a new object in shared memory.

The creation of the object only becomes permanent after a call to Commit.
.PP

.RS 4
\fIobjectName\fP The fully qualified name of the object.

\fIpDefinition\fP The type of object to create (folder, queue, etc.) and the optional definitions (as needed).

The creation of the object only becomes permanent after a call to Commit.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP

.SS "void psoSession::ErrorMsg (char * message, size_t msgLengthInBytes)"
.PP
Return the error message associated with the last error(s). 
.PP
If the length of the error message is greater than the length of the provided buffer, the error message will be truncated to fit in the provided buffer.
.PP
Caveat, some basic errors cannot be captured, if the provided handles (session handles or object handles) are incorrect (NULL, for example). Without a proper handle, the code cannot know where to store the error...
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fImessage\fP Buffer for the error message. Memory allocation for this buffer is the responsability of the caller. 
.br
\fImsgLengthInBytes\fP The length of \fImessage\fP (in bytes). Must be at least 32 bytes.

.SS "void psoSession::Init ()"
.PP
This function initializes a session. 
.PP
This function will also initiate a new transaction.
.PP
Upon normal termination, the current transaction is rolled back. You MUST explicitly call Commit to save your changes.
.PP
\fBExceptions:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpsoException\fP An abnormal error occured. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int psoSession::LastError ()"
.PP
Return the last error seen in previous calls (of the current session). 
.PP
\fBExceptions:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpsoException\fP An abnormal error occured. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void psoSession::Rollback ()"
.PP
Rollback all insertions and deletions (of the current session) executed since the previous call to Commit or Rollback. 
.PP
Insertions and deletions subjected to this call include both data items inserted and deleted from data containers (maps, etc.) and objects themselves created with CreateObject and/or destroyed with DestroyObject.
.PP
Note: the internal calls executed by the engine to satisfy this request cannot fail. As such, you cannot find yourself with an ugly situation where some operations were rollbacked and others not. If this function thows an exception, nothing was rollbacked.
