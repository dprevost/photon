/**
 * Sessions exist mainly to support multi-threaded (MT) programs. 
 *
 * Best practices:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Each thread of an MT program should have its own session, making it
 *     independent of the other threads.
 *   </li>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     If you need to open the same Photon object in multiple threads,
 *     simply open it multiple times using a different session for each
 *     thread. The overhead of having multiple API objects to the same 
 *     shared-memory data container is minimal and using this technique
 *     instead of using multi-thread locks increases the overall 
 *      performance of the software.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     If you cannot use this, you must implement your own thread 
 *     synchronization mecanism.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Signal handlers (and similar calls): you should not call the destructors
 *     of the Process or the Session from a signal handler. 
 *     Instead, some global flags should be set that will allow each session 
 *     to terminate in an orderly fashion.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Additional note: API objects (or C handles) are just proxies for the real 
 * objects sitting in shared memory. Proper synchronization is already done 
 * in shared memory and it is best to avoid the additional synchronization 
 * of these proxy objects.
