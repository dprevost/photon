    * current process) and must be protected. Recommendation: always 
    * set protectionNeeded to false unless you cannot do otherwise. 
    * In other words it is recommended to use one session object for
    * each thread. Also if the same queue needs to be accessed by two 
    * threads it is more efficient to have two different objects instead
    * of sharing a single one.
    * 
    * [Additional note: API objects (or C handles) are just proxies for 
    * the real objects sitting in shared memory. Proper synchronization 
    * is already done in shared memory and it is best to avoid to 
    * synchronize these proxy objects.]

    *            locks are needed or not.
    *
    * \exception psoException An abnormal error occured.
