 * This class is a helper class to build the key definition of
 * Photon objects when this definition is user-defined. 
 *
 * It can be very helpful when your key is made with multiple fields.
 *
 * How it works: you populate your definition with AddKeyField(). When
 * done, you retrieve the definition as an array of bytes and its length
 * and you use that information to create a new key definition in
 * shared memory (using the class ::KeyDefinition).
 *
 * what different about this class? You add a "description" for each of
 * your fields and the builder will insert a null byte to separate them.
 * This will allow DataDefinition::GetNext() to display your definition
 * in a loop as strings.
 *
 * It should be noted that you do not have to use this class, the key 
 * definition can be set directly as an array of bytes.
