/**
 * Photon read-only hash maps (fast maps).
 *
 * The features of fast maps are very similar to the features of standard 
 * hash maps with one major exception - no locks are required to access 
 * the data and special procedures are implemented for the occasional 
 * updates:.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     when a map is open in read-only mode (FastMap::Open), the 
 *     end-of-this-unit-of-work calls (Session::psoCommit, 
 *     Session::psoRollback) will check if a new version of the map 
 *     exist and if indeed this is the case, the new version will be 
 *     use instead of the old one.
 *   </li>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     when a map is open for editing (pso::FastMapEditor) a working copy 
 *     of the map is created in shared memory and the map can be updated
 *     (no locks again since only the updater can access the working copy). 
 *     When the session is committed, the working version becomes the 
 *     latest version and can be open/accessed by readers. And, of course, 
 *     the same procedure applies if you have a set of maps that must be 
 *     changed together.
 *
 *     If Session::psoRollback is called, all changes done to the working 
 *     copy are erased.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Note: the old versions are removed from memory when all readers have 
 * updated their versions. Even if a program is only doing read access to 
 * shared-memory data, it is important to add Session::psoCommit once in a 
 * while to refresh the read-only objects periodically.
