Description: Development tool providing queues, maps in shared memory and more.
 Photon is a development tool for complex server applications. It provides
 data containers like queues and hash maps shared amongst processes,
 in virtual memory.
 .
 Photon as a fast development tool: instead of having one complex multi-threaded
 application doing multiple tasks, it is much simpler to create a bunch of
 programs each doing its own single task. All the programs communicate with
 each other (as needed) using the shared objects in the Virtual Data Space.
