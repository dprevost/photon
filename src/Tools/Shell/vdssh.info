vdssh a^€” starts a pseudo-shell to access VDSF data



Synopsis
********



Getting (minimal) help:
=======================

`vdssh -h|--help|-?'



Running normally:
=================

`vdssh -a|--address' _watchdog_address _



DESCRIPTION
***********

vdssh is a pseudo-shell allowing access to the data in the VDS
(shared-memory used by the VDSF software).

   This program supports a very limited number of standard Bourne shell
commands (and a few equivalent DOS commands). See the section *COMMANDS*
for a list of supported commands (and syntax).



OPTIONS
*******

`-a', `--address' WATCHDOG_ADDRESS
     The TCP port for the VDSF watchdog (the program vdswd).

`-h', `-?', `--help'
     Minimal help including a list of supported commands.


Commands
********

The syntax of the commands is simpler than the equivalent Bourne shell
commands - most commands take no options.

   Names of objects (data containers) can be either absolute (starting
with /) or relative to the current folder (see the *cd * command for an
explanation on how to change the current folder).

*cat* OBJECT_NAME
     Display the content of the object named object_name.

     *Warning: *cat will print the output as strings.

*cd*
     Without a name, change the current folder to "/". Change the
     current folder to folder_name.

*cp*  SOURCE_NAME DEST_NAME
     Copy the source_name object to the dest_name object.

     *Warning:  * dest_name is not overwritten if it already exists.

*del/rm*  OBJECT_NAME
     Delete the data container named object_name.

*dir/ls*
     Without a name, list the objects of the current folder. List the
     objects of the folder folder_name.

*exit/quit*
     Exit the program.

*free*
     Display the amount of used/free memory (main allocator).

*help/man*
     Display the current list of commands.

*mkdir*  FOLDER_NAME
     Create a new folder.

*pwd*
     Display the current folder.

*rmdir*  FOLDER_NAME
     Delete the folder named folder_name.

*stat*  OBJECT_NAME
     Show the status of the object named _object_name_.

*touch -h|-q*  OBJECT_NAME
     Create a new object named object_name of the specified type:

     -h or -hashmap: a hash map
     -q or -queue: a FIFO queue
