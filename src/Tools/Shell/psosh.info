DESCRIPTION
***********

psosh is a pseudo-shell allowing access to the data in the
shared-memory used by the Photon software.

   This program supports a very limited number of standard Bourne shell
commands (and a few equivalent DOS commands). See the section *COMMANDS*
for a list of supported commands (and syntax).



OPTIONS
*******

`-a', `--address' QUASAR_ADDRESS
     The TCP port for the Photon server (quasar).

`-h', `-?', `--help'
     Minimal help including a list of supported commands.


Commands
********

The syntax of the commands is simpler than the equivalent Bourne shell
commands - most commands take no options.

   Names of objects (data containers) can be either absolute (starting
with /) or relative to the current folder (see the *cd * command for an
explanation on how to change the current folder).

*cat* OBJECT_NAME
     Display the content of the object named object_name. The data is
     formatted using the metadata information of the object and is
     displayed as a comma separated list.

*cd*
     Without a name, change the current folder to "/". Change the
     current folder to folder_name.

*cp*  SOURCE_NAME DEST_NAME
     Copy the source_name object to the dest_name object.

     *Warning:  * dest_name is not overwritten if it already exists.

*del/rm*  OBJECT_NAME
     Delete the data container named object_name.

*dir/ls*
     Without a name, list the objects of the current folder. List the
     objects of the folder folder_name.

*echo * DATA > OBJECT_NAME
     Insert a record into the data container named _ object_name _.
     The key should be used for hash maps (if the key exists, the data
     will be replaced instead of being inserted).

     The data should be a list of comma-separated values. The whole list
     must be quoted using apostrophes.

     Note: binary data should be entered using an hexadecimal format
     (the binary data can start with the optional prefix "0x").

*exit/quit*
     Exit the program.

*free*
     Display the amount of used/free memory (main allocator).

*help/man*
     Display the current list of commands.

*mkdir*  FOLDER_NAME
     Create a new folder.

*pwd*
     Display the current folder.

*rmdir*  FOLDER_NAME
     Delete the folder named folder_name.

*stat*  OBJECT_NAME
     Show the status of the object named _object_name_.

*touch -h|-q*  OBJECT_NAME
     Create a new object named object_name of the specified type:

     -h or -hashmap: a hash map
     -q or -queue: a FIFO queue

*touch -x|-xml*  XML_TEXT
     Create a new object using the provided xml text (the xml is of
     course based on the XSD schema for Photon).

     Note: the xml text must be quoted, using apostrophes.
