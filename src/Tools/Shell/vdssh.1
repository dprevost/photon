.TH VDSSH "1" "January 2008 (version 0.2)" VDSF
.SH NAME
vdssh \- starts a pseudo-shell to access VDSF data.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBvdssh -h|--help|-?\fR 
.SS "Running normally:"

.SH DESCRIPTION
vdssh is a pseudo-shell allowing access to the data in the VDS (shared-memory

.SH COMMANDS
The syntax of the commands is simpler than the equivalent Bourne shell 
commands - most commands take no options.
