	* photon: second beta version
     - Transactions are now fully atomic.
     - Ticket 13 is resolved (severe issue with locking).
     - The API can be used standalone (without quasar running), as long
       as there is an existing shared-memory backstore file.
     - Quasar can be used to create/verify a backstore file and then exit
       (with the new -e, --exit option). This can be use to prepare the
       software to be used standalone.

	* photon: version 0.5.0
     - Major update to field and key definitions. Instead of using our
       home-made approach, this update will let programmers use their
       choice of metadata to define the data records and keys.
     - Some predefined metadata approaches are offered as options:
         - Simple ODBC: fixed length fields except for the last one.
           Ideal for mapping to C structs.
         - ODBC: serialized with protobuf. Not done yet.
         - User Defined
     - Serious progress was made with Java, Python and C# but these
       interfacs are not completely ready and will be made available
       in subsequent minor releases.
