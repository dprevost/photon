     - Transactions are now fully atomic.
     - Ticket 13 is resolved (severe issue with locking).
     - The API can be used standalone (without quasar running), as long
       as there is an existing shared-memory backstore file.
     - Quasar can be used to create/verify a backstore file and then exit
       (with the new -e, --exit option). This can be use to prepare the
       software to be used standalone.
